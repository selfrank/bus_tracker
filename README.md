# bus_tracker
Live bus tracking system following Boston Public Transit line 1. 

Utilizes Boston Public Transit API, MapBox, CSS, HTML, and JS. 

Night theme customizations applied using mapbox themes stylesheets.

Markers update every 15 seconds. 

*I welcome feedback especially around the use of info boxes with onclick of marker. I was hoping to display bus label and stop number in info box but ran out of time.
