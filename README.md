# bus_tracker
Live bus tracking system following Boston Public Transit line 1 between MIT and Harvard. 

Utilizes Boston Public Transit API, Google Maps Developer tools, CSS, HTML, and JS. 

Night theme and tilt customizations applied using google developer tools.

Custom icons used for the tracking of direction of bus movement. 

*welcome feedback especially around the use of info boxes with onclick of marker. I was hoping to display bus label and stop number in info box but ran out of time.
