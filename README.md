# bus_tracker
Live bus tracking system following Boston Public Transit line 1. 

Utilizes Boston Public Transit API, MapBox, CSS, HTML, and JS. 

Night theme customizations applied using mapbox themes stylesheets.

Markers update every 15 seconds. 

To run project:
1. Create a mapbox account
2. Update the "you access key here" to the access key provided by mapbox
3. Do not increase the frequency of movement tracking to less than 15 seconds or your API access will be blocked

*I welcome feedback especially around the use of info boxes with onclick of marker. I was hoping to display bus label and stop number in info box but ran out of time.
